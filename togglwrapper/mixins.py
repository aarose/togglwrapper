togglwrapper.mixins
-------------------

This module contains mixins for TogglObject subclasses. The common CRUD
(create, read, update, delete) methods are all used by different Toggl objects,
but in different combinations. Some objects have endpoints for all four
methods, but some only implement two or three of the four (e,g, User only
allows updating and getting, not deleting or creating). Separating the
methods out into mixins allows easy mix-and-matching, and re-useability.

class GetMixin(object):

    def get(self, id=None, child_uri=None, params=None):
        """
        Gets the array of objects, or a specific instance by ID.

        Args:
            id (int, optional): The ID of a specific instance of the Object.
                If none provided, the array of all available instances is
                retrieved, provided that an endpoint exists for it.  Defaults
                to None.
            child_uri (str, optional): The URI of the child Object or subpath.
                e.g. If we wanted the Clients of a Workspace, where the
                Workspace is the parent object, the child URI is '/clients'.
                Defaults to None.
            params (dict, optional): The dictionary of additional params to
                include in as the querystring, appended to the URL. Keys with
                values of None will be ignored. Defaults to None.

                None.
            ids (iterable of ints, optional): An iterable of IDs of instances
                to update. Not all objects allow multiple instances to be
                updated at once - see Toggl's API Documentation to see where
                this is allowed. Defaults to None.
            child_uri (str, optional): The URI/path to append to the object's
                URI, to update. Defaults to None.
